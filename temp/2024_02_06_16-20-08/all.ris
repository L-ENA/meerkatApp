T1  - Monoamine metabolites and amino acids in serum from schizophrenic patients before and during sulpiride treatment
N2  - Twenty-four acutely ill schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R), 18-42 years old, were treated for 6 weeks with sulpiride. Sulpiride was administered in three different daily dosages (starting with 400, 800 or 1200 mg) according to a double blind RANDOMized administration schedule. The monoamine metabolites (MAM) homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy- phenylglycol (HMPG) and the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan, glutamate and glutamine were measured in serum before treatment and once a week during treatment. There were no significant differences between healthy controls and schizophrenic patients in serum levels of monoamine metabolites and amino acids before treatment. There was no dose-response effect of sulpiride on serum levels of the monoamine metabolites or the amino acids. The results are therefore based on the whole group of patients. During treatment the HMPG levels were reduced at all points in time. The serum level of HVA was significantly reduced after 6 weeks. The 5-HIAA and the amino acid levels were not changed during treatment. There were no significant correlations among the monoamine metabolites before treatment. During treatment, however, significant correlations were found among MAM and amino acids. Since the biochemical findings during the treatment were not related to the dose or the concentration of sulpiride the results may be related to secondary biochemical effects of sulpiride and/or to changes in the clinical state following treatment.

T1  - Relationships between clinical effects and monoamine metabolites and amino acids in sulpiride-treated schizophrenic patients
N2  - Twenty-four acutely ill schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R), 18-42 years old, were treated for 6 weeks with sulpiride. Sulpiride was administered in three different daily dosages (400, 800 or 1200 mg) according to a double dummy blind RANDOMized administration schedule. The psychopathology of the patients was rated by the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) and the Nurse's Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE). The monoamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 4- hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylglycol (HMPG) and the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan, glutamate and glutamine were measured in serum before and once a week during sulpiride treatment. There were no significant correlations between the CPRS or the NOSIE morbidity scores and the biochemical measures before drug treatment. HVA levels were not correlated to rating scores during treatment, but after 6 weeks HVA had decreased significantly in the patients with a good response but not in the patients with a poor response. A negative relationship between 5- HIAA levels and depressive and negative symptoms was found. Non-responders according to the subscale for depression had low 5- HIAA levels throughout the treatment. An increase of tryptophan was correlated to improvement in the early part of treatment. High levels of glutamate or glutamine were found in non-responders before treatment. During treatment an increase of the glutamate level was correlated to improvement. Low levels of glutamine were related to improvement according to global and NOSIE (total) rating scores. Peripheral biochemical measures may be a valuable tool in the study of pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment effects in patients with schizophrenia.

T1  - Sulpiride and risperidone vs. "classical neuroleptics" in schizophrenia: a follow-up study
N2  - Negative and refractory symptoms of the disease, plus extrapyramidal and other adverse effects of the classical neuroleptic drugs, constitute two major challenges in the effective management of patients with schizophrenia. The atypical neuroleptics Sulpiride and Clozapine, and the first "new" neuroleptic Risperidone, are promising alternative compounds with demonstrable advantages in both efficacy arguably extending to negative symptoms and lack of extrapyramidal, autonomic and other adverse effects. However, besides uncertainties as to the exact neurochemical changes mediating the therapeutic action of each of these drugs, their relative patterns of potency/adverse effects are also not entirely clear. In view of these, we have been engaged in, an on-going, single-blind, parallel group study, to compare the clinical and adverse effect profiles of Sulpiride and Risperidone, to that of classical neuroleptics. Two fourteen-patient groups with definite chronic schizophrenia (age: 23ys, length of illness 5ys), have so far completed uneventfully ten-week monotherapy with either 300mg of Sulpiride or 6mg of Risperidone. The two groups, only moderately stabilized on one or more classical neuroleptics (Chlorpromazine, Trifluoperazine, Haloperidol), were randomly composed and appeared clinically comparable. All patients conformed to the DSM-III-R range of diagnoses for schizophrenia (295.12/295.32/295.62/295.92) and were free from other major psychiatric disorder, major somatic disorder or other putative psychotropic drugs (e.g. L-DOPA or steroids). However, nine patients remained on an antiparkinson drug and eight on occasional low-dose benzodiazepine for night sedation. Following a three-day washout period (four-week for patients previously on depot neuroleptics), Baseline, five-week and ten-week assessments have been completed, based on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale and the UKU Adverse Effect Scale. The sets of values that were derived were compared within each of the two groups. In addition, the percentage of patients showing over 20% clinical improvement on the total PANSS was estimated, based on the formula: Per cent change in total PANSS = Total PANSS - Total PANSS at Baseline ÷ Total PANSS at Baseline-30 ´ 100 Both Sulpiride and Risperidone proved more potent and better tolerated than the reference drugs, with clearly improved responses on most sets of ratings. At five weeks, significant changes with Sulpiride were noted especially on the General Psychopathology Scale, and interestingly, on the Depression and Anergia subtotal scores. Significant changes with Risperidone, were wide ranging improvements, including improvement of both the total PANSS and total and most subtotal UKU scores. At ten- weeks, these changes partially waned, but did remain widespread, with larger overlap of symptoms affected by the two drugs. Particular relationships of patient and/or illness characteristics to improved symptom patterns, include such features as illness type, duration and speed of progression.

T1  - Sulpiride versus haloperidol in schizophrenia: a double blind comparative trial
N2  - Conducted a multicenter cooperative study in 76 inpatients with paranoid or hebephrenic schizophrenia. After placebo washout, Ss were administered either sulpiride or haloperidol on a flexible-dose schedule for 30 days. Sulpiride proved to be about as active as haloperidol; results show, for sulpiride, a more rapid onset of the therapeutic effects and a wider spectrum of activity. No significant differences were noticed in side effects. In addition to the traditional clinical diagnostic judgment, use was made of an automatic diagnostic assessment produced by the computer on the basis of standardized criteria, and the data obtained from the rating devices were stored in a computer data bank for clinical psychopharmacology, allowing the use of a special "menu" of multivariate programs for the analysis of the results.

T1  - An automated diagnostic process (PDA) in clinical psychopharmacology. An exemplification of its use in a sulpiride versus haloperidol comparative trial
N2  - One of the main unsolved problems, and one which produces divergent results in clinical psychopharmacology, is that concerning the selection of patients and their diagnostic definition. An automated diagnostic procedure (PDA) was set up in order to classify each patient into one nosographic category on the basis of a cross-sectional examination of his mental state. Such diagnostic procedure appears particularly suitable for multicenter drug trials, since it gives a profile and a diagnostic definition of patients, assessed by investigators from different areas and with different cultural, and clinical backgrounds. In a multicenter trial (sulpiride versus haloperidol) PDA offered a chance to re-examine and analyze the characteristics of each patient and therefore to control the criteria followed for the sample selection in the various experimental settings. The agreement between clinician and computer diagnosis was 78.9%; this agreement rises to 85.5% if the computerlabelled schizo- affective syndromes are considered within the schizophrenic group. Moreover, and attempt has been made to relate psychopathological patterns to drug responses.

T1  - Sulpiride and perphenazine in schizophrenia. A double-blind clinical trial
N2  - Seventeen patients with acute schizophrenia and 30 with chronic schizophrenia were included in a randomized, double-blind parallel- group trial comparing sulpiride and perphenazine. Patients were evaluated using the 16-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) prior to the onset of treatment and 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 months thereafter. In patients with acute schizophrenia, total BPRS scores declined significantly at the end of the trial compared with pretreatment values in sulpiride-treated patients but not in schizophrenics treated with perphenazine. Differences in response between the groups did not reach statistical significance, however. For patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia, a statistically significant decline was observed in total BPRS scores at 4 months compared with pretreatment scores in both sulpiride and perphenazine groups. There was no significant difference in the treatment response between the groups. Sulpiride appeared to be somewhat more effective than perphenazine for treatment of acute schizophrenia. Efficacy of both compounds was less marked in chronic forms of schizophrenia.

N2  - In a study with both open and double-blind phases, a therapeutic response to sulpiride was first established in 18 chronic schizophrenic inpatients. Following this, two dosage regiments, a morning only dose, and the same daily total dose in two equal fractions at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., were compared using a balanced design, crossover, placebo controlled study. Clinical effects were evaluated by means of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). There was a significant reduction in the mean BPRS score in all phases of the study. There was no significant difference between the mean BPRS scores resulting from the two dosage regimens. The study indicated that the two dosage regimens were equally efficacious.

N2  - The plasma content of chlorpromazine (CPZ) and its two metabolites 7-OH-chlorpromazine (CPZ-OH) and chlorpromazine sulphoxide (CPZ-SO) were measured in the blood of schizophrenic patients established on chlorpromazine therapy. Administration of the commonly used antimalarial agents chloroquine sulphate, amodiaquine hydrochloride and Fansidar one hour before the first dose of chlorpromazine for the day led to marked increases in CPZ and CPZ-OH over control levels. There were no consistent changes in CPZ-SO levels. The implications of these findings are discussed, first with regard to possible therapeutic relevance for the management of schizophrenia and more particularly, with regard to the possible toxic effects of concurrent administration of antimalarial agents and chlorpromazine.

N2  - Our clinical and statistical evaluation of Sulpiride and Perphenazine was carried out over a 10 week period, in 82 patients of both sexes, aged 20 to 56 years. All were chronic patients with a symptomatic profile of apathy, lack of initiative but with the personality relatively well preserved in 56 patients. The daily dosage varied from 300 to 1,200 mg Sulpiride orally and 12 to 48 mg Perphenazine. The effects of therapy have been received globally and individually at the beginning, 4th, 8th, and the end of the 10th week using the B.P.R.S. modified by the clinic of Neurology and Psychiatry of the University of Hiroshima. Using "Armitage's Restricted Sequential Design", there was no significant difference between the therapeutic effects of these 2 neuroleptics. However, Sulpiride appeared more beneficial following the review during the 8th week and the 4th week.

T1  - Prophylactic effects of neuroleptics in symptom-free schizophrenics: a comparative dose-response study of timiperone and sulpiride
N2  - Remitted schizophrenic outpatients were prophylactically treated to prevent relapse with three different doses of timiperone or sulpiride for a year in a double-blind controlled study employing a RANDOMized design. Each drug's ability to prevent relapse was by counting the number of subjects with different outcomes (remission, relapse, adverse reactions) during the trial and/or the number of symptom-free days for each patient before any sign of relapse or adverse reactions appeared. Patients were RANDOMly assigned to the following drugs, which were orally administered once every night: placebo; timiperone 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg; sulpiride 100 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg. Data from previous studies involving haloperidol and propericiazine were utilized as a retrospective placebo group to compare the characteristics of the four drugs for maintenance treatment of remitted schizophrenic outpatients. Both timiperone and sulpiride increased the number of patients in remission and decreased the number of patients who relapsed, compared with the placebo group. With timiperone, there was an especially marked increase in the number of patients who showed signs of adverse reactions compared with sulpiride. Sulpiride was the only drug that increased the number of dose- dependent symptom-free days. However, both of these drugs significantly increased the number of symptom-free days compared with placebo. By comparing the dose-response curves of four drugs tested in the same fashion, haloperidol and sulpiride were superior to propericiazine and timiperone because they displayed a wider dose range for the maintenance treatment of remitted schizophrenic outpatients.

T1  - Sulpiride in tardive dyskinesia
N2  - The abnormal involuntary movements in tardive dyskinesia can be reduced by the dopamine antagonist drugs, phenothiazines and butyrophenones, but most cause an increase in Parkinsonian signs. Sulpiride, a benzamide derivative, and selective antagonist of D2 receptors had a significantly beneficial effect on most of 15 patients (p less than 0.01). In 12 patients the improvement was marked. The reduction of abnormal movements was observed even with low doses, and it was not necessary to increase the dose of sulpiride above 600 mg daily. There were no significant side effects during the trial nor during an additional three months of treatment.

T1  - Dogmatil and haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia. Double blind cross-over study of therapeutic effectiveness, side effects and plasma concentrations
N2  - French: Résumé. Lors d'un essai croise en double insu, vingt patients schizophrènes chroniques ont reçu successivement du dogmatil et de l’halopéridol, et inversement, au cours de deux périodes de traitement de 12 semaines. La dose médiane finale de dogmatil était de 2 000 mg/jour (fourchette: 800-3 200), celle d’halopéridol de 12 mg/jour (fourchette : 6-24). L’action antipsychotique et le profil thérapeutique du dogmatil n’ont pas différé de façon significative de ceux de l’halopéridol. Malgré l’administration de doses élevées de dogmatil les manifestations extra-pyramidales ont été moins fréquentes au cours des quatre premières semaines de traitement par le dogmatil que pendant la période correspondante de traitement par l’halopéridol (P < 0,05), les effets secondaires intéressant le système nerveux autonome étant tout aussi rares quel que soit le produit utilisé. Une corrélation positive a été décelée entre la dose journalière et la concentration plasmatique pour le dogmatil (P < 0,001) et pour l’halopéridol (P < 0,05), mais aucune corrélation n’a pu être établie entre les effets cliniques et les taux plasmatiques des deux neuroleptiques.
English: Summary. In a double-blind cross-over trial, 20 chronic schizophrenic patients were treated with dogmatil and haloperidol in two 12-week periods. The final median dose of dogmatil was 2 000 mg/day (range 800-3 200), of haloperidol 12 mg/day (range 6-24). Dogmatil had an antipsychotic effect and therapeutic profile not significantly different from those of haloperidol. In spite of the high doses of dogmatil extrapyramidal side effects were seen less frequently during the first 4 weeks of the dogmatil period than during the corresponding haloperidol period (P < 0.05), whereas autonomic side effects were equally rare for both drugs. A positive correlation was found between daily dose and plasma concentration of dogmatil (P < 0.001) and haloperidol (P < 0.05), but no correlation could be established between clinical effects and plasma levels of either neuroleptic.

T1  - Sulpiride versus haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia. A short preliminary report
N2  - Administered sulpiride or haloperidol to 28 chronic schizophrenic patients in a double-blind crossover study. The antipsychotic effect demonstrated for sulpiride--a neuroleptic drug that binds selectively to a subpopulation of D-2 dopamine receptors--was not significantly different from that of haloperidol. It is suggested that this finding may indicate the need to consider the relationship between dopamine receptors and the antipsychotic mechanisms of action of neuroleptic drugs. (English abstract)

T1  - Sulpiride versus haloperidol, a clinical trial in schizophrenia. A preliminary report
N2  - Sixteen out of 25 hebephrenic and paranoid schizophrenic patients completed a double-blind cross-over study with sulpiride and haloperidol. The patient sample was relatively chronic: Median age was 35 years (range 26-53 years), median duration of illness 10 years (4-35 years), and median duration of neuroleptic treatment 5 years (1-28 years). Each patient was treated with sulpiride/haloperidol in random order for 12 weeks with a drug-free period before each treatment phase. Mean total BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) score was reduced from 25 to 15 (P less than 0.05) during sulpiride (800-2800 mg/day, median 1600 mg/day), and from 28 to 15 (P less than 0.01) during haloperidol (6-18 mg/day, median 12). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to total BPRS score, single items or symptom clusters. However, in a few, very "chronic", disturbed, and long-term treated patients, haloperidol appeared more beneficial than sulpiride. Autonomic side effects and parkinsonism tended to occur more frequently during haloperidol than during sulpiride, but no significant differences were found. It is concluded that sulpiride, a specific dopamine-2 receptor blocker, has antipsychotic effect, not significantly different from haloperidol, but may produce slightly less side effects.

T1  - Controlled study of the disinhibiting effect of low doses of sulpiride in severe schizophrenic psychoses
N2  - This controlled study is designed to confirm the clinical impression concerning the dual therapeutic effect of sulpiride (disinhibitory effect at low doses and activity reducer at higher doses). When describing either 150 mg or 1,200 mg of sulpiride for hebephrenic patients, it seems that the benefits only occur in the patients prescribed the smaller dose. The correlation between dosage-plasma level-and beneficial result, is discussed.

N2  - In a double-blind study carried out at 13 medical centres the substance sulpiride (Dogmatil(R)) was compared to chlorpromazine. 61 patients which showed acute psychoses or experienced acute episodes of chronic schizophrenic psychoses, with a total score of at least 40 on the BPRS (brief psychiatric rating scale), received daily doses of up to 1200 mg sulpiride (Dogmatil(R)) or 300 mg chlorpromazine for a period of 21 days. Potency and tolerance of the medications were assessed using different rating scales. Both preparations were found effective and mostly proved to be tolerated well. Sulpiride (Dogmatil(R)) was observed to be superior to chlorpromazine in the vast majority of measured parameters. In some cases this superiority even attained statistical significance.

N2  - Eleven patients with Huntington chorea and nine with delayed dyskinesia were participants in a randomized double blind cross-over study of dogmatil (as the single antidopaminergic treatment) versus placebo. Although we recorded no functional improvement in Huntington chorea patients, dogmatil reduced the frequency of movements and the overall dyskinesia score in both conditions. From a pharmacologic standpoint, dogmatil differs on several accounts from conventional neuroleptics and there is no conclusive evidence that it may produce delayed dyskinesia. Among currently available treatments, dogmatil emerges as the drug of choice for the treatment of delayed dyskinesia.

N2  - Eleven patients with Huntington's disease and nine patients with tardive dyskinesia participated in a randomised double-blind crossover trial of sulpiride (as sole antidopaminergic therapy) versus placebo. Although functional improvement was not seen in Huntington's disease patients, sulpiride reduced movement count and total dyskinesia score in both conditions. Sulpiride differs pharmacologically in several respects from conventional neuroleptics, and has not been convincingly shown to cause tardive dyskinesia. Among currently available treatments, it may therefore be considered a drug of choice for treatment of tardive dyskinesia.

T1  - A single-blind comparison of bromperidol and sulpiride in hospitalized schizophrenics
N2  - Fourty-five schizophrenic inpatients were RANDOMly assigned to bromperidol or sulpiride in an 8 week single-blind clinical trial. No statistically significant differences were observed for final global improvement rating. Regarding BPRS items and compared to sulpiride, bromperidol was particularly effective to relieve emotional withdrawal and hallucinatory behavior, although the only significant between group difference was in favour of sulpiride for improvements of somatic concern. No significant differences were observed for all PES items, although sulpiride was found more effective for hypochondriasis and neurotic complaint as was bromperidol for hallucination and disturbance of self- conscious. The rate of side-effects and abnormal laboratory test results were comparable in the two groups. They were not severe enough to require termination of administration. Bromperidol and sulpiride are concluded to have different clinical profile in the treatment of schizophrenic hospitalized patients.

T1  - A single-blind study of clocapramine and sulpiride in hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients
N2  - The therapeutic effects, safety and side-effects of clocapramine and sulpiride were evaluated in 52 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients using a single-blind method during an 8-week trial period. While the final global improvement rating showed clocapramine to be superior to sulpiride, the differences were not statistically significant. The time course of the total psychiatric rating scales (PRS) showed a progressive decline during treatment for both drugs, and at the end of treatment clocapramine proved significantly lower in total PRS than did sulpiride. In the improvement of psychotic symptoms, clocapramine seemed to be superior to sulpiride with respect to motor retardation, delusion, hallucination or disturbance of self-consciousness, social isolation or withdrawal, and recreation or work. Side-effects appeared more frequently with clocapramine than with sulpiride, but abnormal laboratory-test results appeared less in clocapramine-treated patients than in sulpiride-treated ones. Neither side-effects nor abnormal laboratory-test results induced by the two drugs were severe enough to terminate administration. Clocapramine is concluded to have a more favourable effect on negative symptoms, as well as on some positive symptoms of chronic schizophrenia, than sulpiride.

T1  - A double-blind comparison of sulpiride with chlorpromazine in chronic schizophrenia
N2  - Clinical effectiveness of sulpiride in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia was assessed by comparison with chlorpromazine as a standard drug. The following items were mainly compared: effectiveness on chronic schizophrenia, effectiveness on various symptoms, side effects induced by both drugs and the changes in laboratory findings after drug administration. The subjects consisted of 76 hospitalized schizophrenics, of whom 60 were males and 16 females. 38 pairs were set up from any group of three major type stratified as follows; patients with hallucinations or delusions, with stupor or psychomotor excitements and with apathy or lacking spontaneity. Each pair consists of patients of the same sex and within a 10-year disparity in age. After a wash-out period lasting three to five days the patients were given sulpiride (100mg per tablet) or chlorpromazine (50mg per tablet) in a daily dose of 3 tablets at first prescription, the dose being individualized thereafter depending on the symptoms of each patient. Global comparitive judgement of the effectiveness after eight-week administration showed that sulpiride was more effective than chlorpromazine in 23 pairs. The latter drug was more effective than the former in 13 pairs. There was 1 tied pair, and 1 pair was regarded as a dropping-out case. Of the 57 patients who showed improvement 33 were on sulpiride. 4 patients on sulpiride and 13 on chlorpromazine showed no clinical improvement

T1  - Sulpiride augmentation in people with schizophrenia partially responsive to clozapine. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study
N2  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that a combined regimen of clozapine, a relatively weak D2-dopaminergic antagonist, and sulpiride, a selective D2 blocker, would demonstrate a greater antipsychotic efficacy by enhancing the D2 blockade of clozapine. METHOD: Twenty-eight people with schizophrenia, previously unresponsive to typical antipsychotics and only partially responsive to current treatment with clozapine, received, double-blind, 600 mg/day sulpiride or placebo, in addition to an ongoing clozapine treatment. The clinical status was evaluated before, during, and at the end of 10 weeks of sulpiride addition using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: The clozapine- sulpiride group exhibited substantially greater and significant improvements in positive and negative psychotic symptoms. About half of them, characterised by a younger age and lower baseline SAPS scores, had a mean reduction of 42.4 and 50.4% in their BPRS and SAPS scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with chronic schizophrenia may substantially benefit from sulpiride addition to clozapine.

T1  - Comparison of efficacy of clozapine, sulpiride, chlorpromazine and haloperidol in chronic schizophrenic patients therapy
N2  - There are many efforts to find out how to manage with chronic schizophrenia symptoms and many antipsychotics with different mechanism of action are marketed and used. Many investigations regarding their effects have been informed but still there is no consensus on which of them is the best acting in schizophrenic patients. Aim of this study was to compare he efficacy of clozapine, sulpiride, chlorpromazine and haloperidol in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. 120 patients diagnosed as chronic schizophrenia according to DSM - IV diagnostic criterias were given randomly these four group antipsychotics. Each group consisted of 40 patients. Avarage dose of clozapine, haloperidol, sulpiride and chlorpromazine was 462.661 mg/day, 34.75 mg/day, 696 mg/day and 454 mg/day respectively. In order to see their antipsychotic efficacy, patients were evaluated by using Brief Psychiatric Raiting Scale (BPRS) on the 0., 1., 30., 60. and 90th day of the treatment and the differences between the scores of BPRS for each treatment group was evaluated by using anova method. To find out the group causing the difference, Sheffe analysis was used in the SPSS package program. All of the four antipsychotics used in this study had an antipsychotic efficacy during the 90 day of the treatment. But comparing the groups, the most efficient results were obtained in the clozapine group, whereas the sulpiride group was the second efficient one and chlorpromazin and haloperidol had an equal antipsychotic effects. (p < 0.01) Clozapine and sulpiride are antipsychotic drugs, showing different mechanism of action then chlorpromazine and haloperidol. Their different mechanism of actions are generally cause them to be more effective then classical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenic symptoms.

N2  - Effects of dogmatil and chlorpromazine were compared in a DOUBLE blind study in 50 young schizophrenic patients. Daily dosages were 800 mg and 400 mg respectively for 8 weeks. Dogmatil had a faster effect on autistic behavior but no difference emerged as concerns symptoms of depression. Response was more noticeable for low dosages of dogmatil, and less marked when serum concentrations were high. No similar correlation was evidenced for chlorpromazine.

T1  - Clinical evaluation of sulpiride in schizophrenic patients - a double-blind comparison with chlorpromazine
N2  - To evaluate the clinical potential of sulpiride for the treatment of schizophrenic patients, a double-blind study was performed comparing fixed doses of sulpiride (800 mg daily) and chlorpromazine (400 mg daily). Twenty-five schizophrenic (RDC) patients participated in each treatment group. Antipsychotic effects were evaluated by CPRS and NOSIE ratings before and after 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Interrater reliabilities for CPRS items and subscales were satisfactory. Treatment with sulpiride or chlorpromazine resulted in a significant reduction of psychotic morbidity as estimated by CPRS and global ratings. CPRS scores reflecting autism were significantly reduced in all ratings of sulpiride- treated patients, but only after four weeks in the chlorpromazine group. Total NOSIE scores indicated improvement in both treatment groups. A significant difference in favour of sulpiride was obtained for the NOSIE subscale "retardation". Extrapyramidal side effects occurred at a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Autonomic side effects occurred to a greater extent in chlorpromazine-treated patients. Lactation was reported only in four sulpiride-treated patients. Liver transaminase enzymes in serum were markedly elevated only in chlorpromazine-treated patients. The results indicate that sulpiride has a marked antipsychotic effect which is at least not inferior to that of chlorpromazine. A better effect on autistic components of behaviour was demonstrated for sulpiride. The results indicate a higher risk of lactation but a lower risk of anticholinergic side effects and liver toxicity for treatment with sulpiride than with chlorpromazine.

T1  - Time course for effects of sulpiride and chlorpromazine on monoamine metabolite and prolactin levels in cerebrospinal fluid from schizophrenic patients
N2  - Schizophrenic patients were treated with the dopamine (DA)-2 receptor blocking drug sulpiride (800 mg daily) or the non-selective DA receptor blocking compound chlorpromazine (400 mg daily). Samples of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were drawn before and after 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Concentrations of the monoamine metabolites HVA, MOPEG and 5-HIAA in CSF and of prolactin (PRL) in CSF and serum were determined. In both treatment groups there were significant and similar elevations of HVA concentrations. HVA levels reached peaks after 1 to 2 weeks treatment and subsequently declined almost to the pretreatment level after 8 weeks. CSF and serum levels of PRL reached maximal levels within 2 weeks and remained stable at that level in both treatment groups. There were significantly higher PRL levels in sulpiride- than in chlorpromazine-treated patients. Women had higher PRL elevations in CSF in both treatment groups. The HVA/PRL ratio in CSF was significantly reduced in the sulpiride but not in the chlorpromazine group. After 1 week there was a significantly elevated 5- HIAA level in the chlorpromazine but not in the sulpiride group. In both groups, the MOPEG concentrations were significantly reduced in relation to pretreatment levels. The reduction was significantly more pronounced in the chlorpromazine group. The results indicate that sulpiride affects central DA metabolism in a similar way as chlorpromazine when administered in doses that induce antipsychotic effects. After both drugs evidence was obtained for the development of tolerance to the effect on the receptors that regulate HVA levels in the CSF but not to receptors regulating PRL release. The different effects of the drugs on PRL, 5-HIAA and MOPEG levels indicate that sulpiride has a more specific effect than chlorpromazine on dopaminergic mechanisms.

T1  - Sulpiride augmentation of olanzapine in the management of treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia: evidence for improvement of mood symptomatology
N2  - Several recent studies, albeit limited in sample number, design and generalizability, have suggested that augmentation of atypical antipsychotic medication (such as clozapine and olanzapine) with sulpiride, a substituted benzamide antipsychotic medication, may play a role in the management of treatment-resistant psychotic conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate any change in clinical symptomatology or side-effect profile in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients receiving sulpiride in addition to olanzapine. Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia, who were receiving olanzapine monotherapy for at least 6 months before study commencement, were RANDOMized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either adjunctive treatment with sulpiride (study group) or to continue their pre-study treatment with olanzapine with no medication augmentation (control group), each for a period of 8 weeks. Changes in measures of positive and negative symptoms, anxiety, depression and extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 8 weeks. Study observations indicated no significant differences in the changes in positive or negative symptomatology between patients receiving a combined regimen of olanzapine with sulpiride (600 mg/ day) augmentation and controls. However, a significantly greater improvement of depressive symptomatology (P < 0.05; as assessed by the Hamilton Scale for Depression) was noted in the sulpiride augmentation group. These data indicate improvement in depressive symptomatology with sulpiride augmentation of olanzapine in treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia patients.

T1  - Effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics on glucose-insulin homeostasis and lipid metabolism in first-episode schizophrenia
N2  - Rationale: Glucose and lipid metabolism dysfunction is a significant side effect associated with antipsychotics. Although there are many studies about the linkages between drugs and metabolic dysfunction, most of these studies have compared the effects of two antipsychotics on only one metabolic measure: either glucose or lipid metabolism. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and sulpiride on glucose and lipid metabolism in first-episode schizophrenia. Materials and methods: One hundred twelve schizophrenics were assigned randomly to receive clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or sulpiride for 8 weeks. Planned assessments included body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, insulin resistance index (IRI), cholesterol, and triglyceride. All measures were collected at baseline and at the end of the 8-week treatment. Results: After treatment, insulin, C-peptide, and IRI were significantly increased in the four groups, but not fasting glucose levels. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly increased in the clozapine and olanzapine groups. Patients treated with clozapine and olanzapine had higher fasting insulin, C-peptide, and IRI levels than those treated with risperidone and sulpiride. Among the four antipsychotics, the increases of mean BMI from high to low were as follows: clozapine, olanzapine, sulpiride, and risperidone. Conclusions: This study confirmed that the four antipsychotic drugs were associated with an increase of insulin, C-peptide, and IRI. It was found that clozapine and olanzapine were associated with an increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The effects of clozapine and olanzapine on the glucose and lipid metabolism outweighed those of risperidone and sulpiride.

T1  - Effect of risperidone on quality of life in schizophrenics
N2  - Objective: To investigate risperidone on the quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: 64 cases of patients with schizophrenia were randomly divided into risperidone group and sulpiride group 6 months of treatment with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (scores of BPRS) side effects scale (TESS) evaluate the efficacy and adverse drug reactions, quality of life assessed using the World Health Organization quality of Life Scale (WHO QOL-100). results: after 6 months of treatment, the two groups BPRS score significant difference (P <0.05), TESS score was significantly lower than in the risperidone group sulpiride group (P <0.01); the risperidone group WHO QOL-100 in various fields in addition to the spiritual pillar significantly improved, in the physical domain, psychological the sulpiride group of the field, the independence of the field, the field of social relations, and overall quality of life improved significantly (P <0.05

T1  - RREC 2357 - health technology assessment programme: cost utility of the latest anti-psychotics and severe schizophrenia (CUTLASS): a multicentre, randomised-controlled study (MREC 98/8/53)
N2  - This randomised, controlled trial aims to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the new antipsychotic drugs compared to conventional antipsychotic drugs and to clozopine in a sample of seven hundred and two people with schizophrenia who are resistant to or intolerant of, usual treatment. The trial will aim to demonstrate important differences in quality of life and other outcomes at one year, assess value for money, and identify cost-effective management strategies. The trial aims to answer the following questions. Do the atypical drugs lead to better outcomes for treatment-resistant patients? What is the cost of this improvement (cost utility)? Are these drugs cheaper for the NHS overall? Randomised controlled trial. The study design will be a multi-centre, pragmatic, single blind, randomised, controlled trial, comparing conventional antipsychotic drugs with clozapine with the new atypical drugs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and treatment-intolerant schizophrenia. The trial will include and integrate clinical and economic evaluation. A pragmatic trial design was chosen to test effectiveness in the context of current, informed clinical practice. The characteristics for a pragmatic trial in this context are: 1. Trial entry defined by the clinician making a decision to change drug management; 2. Naturalistic: reflects clinical practice with an un-restrictive entry criteria; The choice of which conventional or which atypical drug to use within the randomly-selected treatments is made by the clinician, with access to the best current data. 3. Clinician and patient are not blind to treatment allocation; 4. The follow-up is non-intensive The characteristics will be set in a formal RCT framework which will include the following characteristics: 1. Concealed randomisation; 2. Blind independent assessment of outcome; 3. Characterisation and follow-up of refusers and dropouts; 4. Intention-to-treat analysis The study will be conducted at four centres in the UK Participants: The study sample population can be described as patients that are having medication changes due to intolerance or resistance to existing medication. Outcomes: Clinical, quality of life and economic assessments. Standardised rating of scales of symptoms, side effects, quality of life, social functioning and economic service utilisation will be administered at baseline and 52 weeks. In addition, at weeks 12 and 26, subsets of these instruments will be administered by the blind, independent rater.

T1  - Cost utility of the latest antipsychotics in severe schizophrenia (CUtLASS): a multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial
N2  - Antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs remain central to the treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Conventional drugs are effective in 70% of patients but have frequent neurological side effects. The atypical antipsychotics are a new class of drugs with a lower risk of these side effects and, in the case of clozapine, better efficacy. The cost of these new drugs is 20-30 times that of conventional drugs. There are currently no reliable data about their comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in NHS settings in which to guide practice. If their use continues to expand, the annual drugs budget for schizophrenia in England will increase from œ32 million to œ240 million. A 4-centre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial is proposed, to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the new drugs compared to conventional drugs and to clozapine in a sample of 702 people with schizophrenia who are resistant to or intolerant of usual treatment. The trial will aim to demonstrate important differences in quality of life and other outcomes at 1 year, assess value for money and identify cost-effective management strategies.

T1  - The effects of new antipsychotic drugs on cognitive function in schizophrenia
N2  - The effects of new antipsychotic drugs on cognitive function in schizophrenia. Subjects will undergo neuropsychological assessment before changing antipsychotic medication to establish baseline performance. The effects of the change in medication will be assessed after 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Neuropsychological measures: Experimental tests will be taken from the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB). Tests will be used which: a) are sensitive to antisychotic medication effects; b) hypothetically will discriminate between atypical and conventional drugs; and c) specifically measure the executive function of the frontal lobe. It is predicted that a switch from a conventional to an atypical drug will improve performance on these tasks independently of any change in symptoms and that a switch from atypical to conventional drugs will impair performance. These tests are: attentional set shifting task; Tower of London planning task; spatial recognition memory and spatial working memory. A test of rapid visual information processing will also be used. It is predicted that any improvement on this task will be correlated with improvement in symptoms whatever the nature of the change in antipsychotic drug. We will also test pattern recognition memory which reflects the integrity of the posterior temporal lobe. It is predicted that there will be no change in performance. All patients will also be given the National Adult Reading Test to estimate IQ. This will be used to ascertain whether the groups are matched for IQ. If not, IQ will be used as a covariate in testing for group differences on CANTAB tests. This set of tests has been designed to last 45 minutes which, in our experience, is acceptable to most patients. The following clinical assessments are being performed as part of the CUtLASS study: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Global Assessment of Function; Social and Behaviour Schedule; Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenics; simpsona dn Angus Scale; Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. 25-50 subjects (PROJ 21/03/2001)

T1  - Randomised controlled trials of conventional antipsychotic versus new atypical drugs, and new atypical drugs versus clozapine, in people with schizophrenia responding poorly to, or intolerant of, current drug treatment
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different classes of antipsychotic drug treatment in people with schizophrenia responding inadequately to, or having unacceptable side-effects from, their current medication. DESIGN: Two pragmatic, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken. The first RCT (band 1) compared the class of older, inexpensive conventional drugs with the class of new atypical drugs in people with schizophrenic disorders, whose current antipsychotic drug treatment was being changed either because of inadequate clinical response or owing to side-effects. The second RCT (band 2) compared the new (non-clozapine) atypical drugs with clozapine in people whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to two or more antipsychotic drugs. Both RCTs were four-centre trials with concealed randomisation and three follow-up assessments over 1 year, blind to treatment. SETTING: Adult mental health settings in England. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 227 participants aged 18-65 years (40% of the planned sample) were randomised to band 1 and 136 (98% of the planned sample) to band 2. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to a class of drug. The managing clinician selected the individual drug within that class, except for the clozapine arm in band 2. The new atypical drugs included risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and amisulpride. The conventional drugs included older drugs, including depot preparations. As in routine practice, clinicians and participants were aware of the identity of the prescribed drug, but clinicians were asked to keep their participating patient on the randomised medication for at least the first 12 weeks. If the medication needed to be changed, the clinician was asked to prescribe another drug within the same class, if possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Secondary clinical outcomes included symptoms [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], side-effects and participant satisfaction. Economic outcomes were costs of health and social care and a utility measure. RESULTS: Recruitment to band 1 was less than anticipated (40%) and diminished over the trial. This appeared largely due to loss of perceived clinical equipoise (clinicians progressively becoming more convinced of the superiority of new atypicals). Good follow-up rates and a higher than expected correlation between QLS score at baseline and at follow-up meant that the sample as recruited had 75% power to detect a difference in QLS score of 5 points between the two treatment arms at 52 weeks. The recruitment to band 2 was approximately as planned. Follow-up assessments were completed at week 52 in 81% of band 1 and 87% of band 2 participants. Band 1 data showed that, on the QLS and symptom measures, those participants in the conventional arm tended towards greater improvements. This suggests that the failure to find the predicted advantage for new atypicals was not due to inadequate recruitment and statistical power in this sample. Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug. There were no statistically significant differential outcomes for participants entering band 1 for reasons of treatment intolerance to those entering because of broadly defined treatment resistance. Net costs over the year varied widely, with a mean of pound 18,850 in the conventional drug group and pound 20,123 in the new atypical group, not a statistically significant difference. Of these costs, 2.1% and 3.8% were due to antipsychotic drug costs in the conventional and atypical group, respectively. There was a trend towards participants in the conventional drug group scoring more highly on the utility measure at 1 year. The results for band 2 showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in quality of life (QLS) at trend level (p = 0.08) and in symptoms (PANSS), which was statistically significant (p = 0.01), at 1 year. Clozapine showed approximately a 5-point advantage on PANSS total score and a trend towards having fewer total extrapyramidal side-effects. Participants reported at 12 weeks that their mental health was significantly better with clozapine than with new atypicals (p < 0.05). Net costs of care varied widely, but were higher than in band 1, with a mean of pound 33,800 in the clozapine group and pound 28,400 in the new atypical group. Of these costs, 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively, were due to antipsychotic drug costs. The increased costs in the clozapine group appeared to reflect the licensing requirement for inpatient admission for commencing the drug. There was a trend towards higher mean participant utility scores in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS: For band 1, there is no disadvantage in terms of quality of life and symptoms, or associated costs of care, over 1 year in commencing conventional antipsychotic drugs rather than new atypical drugs. Conventional drugs were associated with non-significantly better outcomes and lower costs. Drug costs represented a small proportion of the overall costs of care (<5%). For band 2, there is a statistically significant advantage in terms of symptoms but not quality of life over 1 year in commencing clozapine rather than new atypical drugs, but with increased associated costs of care. The results suggest that conventional antipsychotic drugs, which are substantially cheaper, still have a place in the treatment of patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, current medication. Further analyses of this data set are planned and further research is recommended into areas such as current antipsychotic treatment guidance, valid measures of utility in serious mental illness, low-dose 'conventional' treatment in first episode schizophrenia, QLS validity and determinants of QLS score in schizophrenia, and into the possible financial and other mechanisms of rewarding clinician participation in trials.

T1  - Randomized controlled trial of the effect on quality of life of second- vs first-generation antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizophrenia Study (CUtLASS 1)
N2  - Context: Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are more expensive than first-generation (typical) antipsychotics (FGAs) but are perceived to be more effective, with fewer adverse effects, and preferable to patients. Most evidence comes from short-term efficacy trials of symptoms. Objective: To test the hypothesis that in people with schizophrenia requiring a change in treatment, SGAs other than clozapine are associated with improved quality of life across 1 year compared with FGAs. Design: A noncommercially funded, pragmatic, multisite, randomized controlled trial of antipsychotic drug classes, with blind assessments at 12, 26, and 56 weeks using intention-to-treat analysis. Setting: Fourteen community psychiatric services in the English National Health Service. Participants: Two hundred twenty-seven people aged 18 to 65 years with DSM-IV schizophrenia and related disorders assessed for medication review because of inadequate response or adverse effects. Interventions: Randomized prescription of either FGAs or SGAs (other than clozapine), with the choice of individual drug made by the managing psychiatrist. Main Outcome Measures: Quality of Life Scale scores, symptoms, adverse effects, participant satisfaction, and costs of care. Results: The primary hypothesis of significant improvement in Quality of Life Scale scores during the year after commencement of SGAs vs FGAs was excluded. Participants in the FGA arm showed a trend toward greater improvements in Quality of Life Scale and symptom scores. Participants reported no clear preference for either drug group; costs were similar. Conclusions: In people with schizophrenia whose medication is changed for clinical reasons, there is no disadvantage across 1 year in terms of quality of life, symptoms, or associated costs of care in using FGAs rather than nonclozapine SGAs. Neither inadequate power nor patterns of drug discontinuation accounted for the result. RN 0 (Antipsychotic Agents).

T1  - Cost utility of the latest antipsychotics in severe schizophrenia (CUtLASS): a multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial
N2  - Antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs remain central to the treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Conventional drugs are effective in 70% of patients but have frequent neurological side effects. The atypical antipsychotics are a new class of drugs with a lower risk of these side effects and, in the case of clozapine, better efficacy. The cost of these new drugs is 20-30 times that of conventional drugs. There are currently no reliable data about their comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in NHS settings in which to guide practice. If their use continues to expand, the annual drugs budget for schizophrenia in England will increase from £32 million to £240 million. A 4-centre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial is proposed, to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the new drugs compared to conventional drugs and to clozapine in a sample of 702 people with schizophrenia who are resistant to or intolerant of usual treatment. The trial will aim to demonstrate important differences in quality of life and other outcomes at 1 year, assess value for money and identify cost-effective management strategies. Design/methodology: A 4-centre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial Participants - inclusion criteria: Schizophrenics who are intolerant or resistant to usual treatment Participants - exclusion criteria: 1. Substance use or organic illness as the main cause of psychotic symptoms. Anticipated start date: 01/03/1999 Anticipated end date: 28/02/2002 Status of trial: Completed Interventions: 1. New drugs

T1  - First generation versus second generation (non-clozapine) antipsychotic drugs versus clozapine in schizophrenia: the Cutlass trials
N2  - Background: Two non-commercially-funded, pragmatic, open, multisite, randomised, controlled trials (CUtLASS 1 and 2) were conducted in the UK NHS in order (i) to compare SGAs (other than clozapine) with FGAs, in people with schizophrenia requiring a change of treatment because of inadequate response or adverse effects and (ii) to compare clozapine with the class of other SGAs in people who had responded poorly to two or more prior antipsychotic drugs. The hypotheses were that SGA drugs would outperform FGA drugs; and clozapine would outperform other SGA drugs. Methods: Participants were aged 18-65 with DSM-4 schizophrenia and related disorders. In CUtLASS 1, participants were randomly allocated to either FGA or SGA classes (amisulpride, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone). In CUtLASS 2, participants were randomly allocated to clozapine, or to one of the other SGA drugs. The choice of individual drug within the allocated class was made in advance by the managing clinician. Randomised samples were 227 and 136 respectively. Outcomes were assessed blind to treatment allocation at 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Complete follow up assessments at one year were obtained in 81% and 87% of the samples respectively. Results: In CUtLASS 1, there were no advantages of SGA over FGA drugs. Participants in the FGA arm showed a trend toward greater improvements in QLS and PANSS scores. Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug; costs were similar. In CUt- LASS 2, an intent to treat comparison showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in QLS score at trend level (3.6 points; CI 0.5-7.7; p=0.08), and in PANSS total score that was statistically significant (4.9 points; CI 1.1-8.8; p=0.01), at one year. At 12 weeks, participants receiving clozapine reported that their mental health was significantly better compared with those receiving SGA drugs. Discussion: In people with schizophrenia whose medication is changed for clinical reasons, there is no clinical or cost advantage over one year in using non-clozapine FGA drugs rather than clozapine SGA drugs. Neither inadequate power nor patterns of drug discontinuation could account for this result. There is an advantage to commencing clozapine rather than other SGA drugs in terms of symptoms and patient preference over one year.

T1  - First- vs second-generation antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia
N2  - The Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizophrenia Study (CUtLASS 1)1 found that, in patients with schizophrenia whose medication was changed for clinical reasons, first(FGA)- and second (SGA)-generation antipsychotics were associated with comparable 1-year outcomes on measures of clinical improvement, adverse effects, quality of life, and costs of care. We have several concerns about the study: 1. During the study, 55 of 118 patients (47%) switched from an FGA to an SGA, but only 36 of 109 (33%) switched from an SGA to an FGA (Figure 11[p1081]); the advantage for the SGA was statistically significant (_2 1=4.35; P_.05). The most commonly prescribed FGA and SGA were sulpiride and olanzapine, respectively; the 1-year persistence rates for these drugs were 28 of 58 (48%) and 37 of 50 (74%), respectively. The advantage for olanzapine was statistically significant (_2 1=7.42; P_.001). Neither analysis was presented in the article. 2. The sample was poorly treatment responsive; at 1 year, the average patient showed less than 10% improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score. Therefore, a floor effect may have prevented the identification of differential effectiveness of the medications. A previous study,2 which compared olanzapine and haloperidol across 1 year, also failed to find an effectiveness difference between the 2 drugs for likely similar reasons. 3. Most clinicians and educated patients probably believe that the SGAs are better than the FGAs. The referral and consenting procedures could therefore have loaded the sample with 2 types of patients: those who had previously responded to and tolerated an FGA and those who had previously not responded to or not tolerated an SGA. In other words, there could have been a hidden bias in favor of the FGA and against the SGA. 4. Twelve FGA patients were prescribed a depot drug from the outset; the consequently better compliance may have biased the results in favor of the FGA group. Additionally, by the end of the study, 6 more FGA patients and 17 SGA patients were receiving depot preparations. If poor medication compliance was a patient characteristic and was responsible for the switch from SGA to depot medication, outcomes (before the switch) with the SGA could have been compromised and the use of FGA depot drugs by SGA patients could have further decreased the likelihood of statistical separation of the groups in at least some of the analyses. 5. Sulpiride was the most commonly prescribed FGA (in 49% of the FGA group). However, this drug is closer to the atypical antipsychotics than to the neuroleptics in its clinical profile.3 Therefore, readers should not assume that the favorable outcomes with the FGA mean that all FGAs in general, and the neuroleptics in particular, are just as effective and as well tolerated as the atypical antipsychotics. 6. Finally, the ecological validity of the study may be limited to countries with a social and health care structure similar to that of the United Kingdom. This is because outcomes with antipsychotic drugs depend not only on the drugs but also on factors such as levels of social and family stress and social and family support.

T1  - Second generation antipsychotics improve sexual dysfunction in schizophrenia: A randomised controlled trial
N2  - The impact of antipsychotic drug treatment on sexual function was investigated during a randomised trial comparing first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) to (nonclozapine) second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Sexual function and quality of life were (rater-blind) assessed in 42 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (aged 18-65) using the self-report version of the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function (DISF-SR) and the Heinrichs Quality of Life Scale (QLS), prior to, and 12 weeks following, a change in medication from an FGA drug to either an FGA or SGA drug. SGAs significantly improved sexual function compared to FGAs. Change in sexual function was associated with change in quality of life. Where impaired sexual functioning is a distressing adverse effect of treatment with an FGA agent, consideration should be given to switching to an SGA. 2011 Ahmed Mahmoud et al.

T1  - Extrapyramidal motor side-effects of first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs
N2  - BackgroundSecond-generation antipsychotics have been thought to cause fewer extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) than first-generation antipsychotics, but recent pragmatic trials have indicated equivalence.AimsTo determine whether second-generation antipsychotics had better outcomes in terms of EPS than first-generation drugs.MethodWe conducted an intention-to-treat, secondary analysis of data from an earlier randomised controlled trial (n=227). A clinically significant difference was defined as double or half the symptoms in groups prescribed first- v. second-generation antipsychotics, represented by odds ratios greater than 2.0 (indicating advantage for first-generation drugs) or less than 0.5 (indicating advantage for the newer drugs). We also examined EPS in terms of symptoms emergent at 12 weeks and 52 weeks, and symptoms that had resolved at these time points.ResultsAt baseline those randomised to the first-generation antipsychotic group (n = 118) had similar EPS to the second-generation group (n = 109). Indications of resolved Parkinsonism (OR = 0.5) and akathisia (OR = 0.4) and increased tardive dyskinesia (OR = 2.2) in the second-generation drug group at 12 weeks were not statistically significant and the effects were not present by 52 weeks. Patients in the second-generation group were dramatically (30-fold) less likely to be prescribed adjunctive anticholinergic medication, despite equivalence in terms of EPS.ConclusionsThe expected improvement in EPS profiles for participants randomised to second-generation drugs was not found; the prognosis over 1 year of those in the first-generation arm was no worse in these terms. The place of careful prescription of first-generation drugs in contemporary practice remains to be defined, potentially improving clinical effectiveness and avoiding life-shortening metabolic disturbances in some patients currently treated with the narrow range of second-generation antipsychotics used in routine practice. This has educational implications because a generation of psychiatrists now has little or no experience with first-generation antipsychotic prescription.

T1  - Non-neurological and metabolic side effects in the Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia Randomised Controlled Trial (CUtLASS-1)
N2  - The impact of non-neurological and metabolic side effects (NNSEs) on the prescription of antipsychotics in real clinical practice remains unclear. We conducted an intention-to-treat, secondary analysis of data from a randomised, controlled trial (CUtLASS-1; n=227) to examine NNSEs emergent at 12 weeks and 52 weeks. A clinically significant difference was defined as double or half the symptoms in groups prescribed first- versus second-generation antipsychotics, represented by odds ratios greater than 2.0 (indicating advantage for first-generation drugs) or less than 0.5 (indicating advantage for the newer drugs). There were no differences between the treatment groups at baseline. At both 12 and 52 weeks follow-up, patients on second-generation drugs were more likely than their first-generation counterparts to experience cardiovascular problems and anticholinergic side effects, as well as increased sexual side effects in men. Objective weight gain was equivalent between the two groups at 12 weeks, but by one year fewer patients in the second-generation arm experienced weight gain and there was no significant difference with regard to percent change in BMI. These results suggest that there may be clinically significant increases in anticholinergic, cardiovascular, and sexual side effects for patients on second-generation drugs. The expected increased weight gain in the second-generation arm did not occur. This study provides evidence that clinicians should take a more nuanced approach toward expert antipsychotic prescription, rather than viewing the drugs as distinct classes.

T1  - Patients' subjective rating of mental health improvement in a randomised controlled trial
N2  - We used UK CUtLASS RCT data to establish that patients' rating of mental health improvement (baseline to week 12) correlated significantly with percentage symptom improvement (PANSS). In a regression analysis predictors of the patient's week 12 mental health rating were percentage change in positive symptoms (PANSS), DAI score and the patient's rating of side effects. Patients in an RCT were able to subjectively rate their mental health status, validated by objective improvement on the PANSS.

T1  - Improved quality of life over one year is associated with improved adherence in patients with schizophrenia
N2  - AIM: Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly considered an important outcome in health research. We wished to explore the determinants of change in QoL in patients with schizophrenia over the course of a one-year RCT. METHODS: Predictors of change in observer-rated QoL (Quality of Life Scale: QLS) were assessed in 363 patients with schizophrenia during the CUtLASS clinical trial. RESULTS: Change in QLS score over the course of a year correlated with change in psychotic and depressive symptoms and treatment adherence. Linear regression showed that improvement in QoL was predicted by reduction in negative and depressive symptoms and improvement in adherence rating. These three change scores together explained 38% of the variance in QLS change. Exploration of the direction of any possible causal effect, using TETRAD, indicated that improved adherence leads to improved QoL, and that change in depression also leads to QoL change. The relationship between QoL and negative symptoms suggests that greater social activity (reflected as better QoL scores) improves negative symptoms. Such a direct relationship between treatment adherence and QoL has not been reported before. CONCLUSION: Improving adherence to medication would appear to be a key approach to improving measured quality of life in people with schizophrenia.

T1  - The CATIE and CUtLASS studies in schizophrenia: results and implications for clinicians
N2  - Numerous double-blind studies have compared second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), with most finding better efficacy and tolerability for SGAs. However, these 'efficacy trials' were generally short term and included only highly selected patients. Mostly because of weight gain and other metabolic effects of the SGAs, as well as their high acquisition price, the debate on the (cost) effectiveness of the SGAs led to two pragmatic clinical trials with no sponsorship by industry. Both trials had broad inclusion criteria and long follow-up, and tried to mimic clinical routine: CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) and CUtLASS (Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic drugs in Schizophrenia Study). 1493 patients participated in CATIE, an 18-month, double-blind trial comparing the SGAs olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone with the FGA perphenazine. If efficacy or tolerability was insufficient, patients were re-randomized to a medication other than the one they previously received. Improvement of psychopathology and of quality of life was only moderate. Overall, 74% of patients discontinued study medication before 18 months, and the median time to discontinuation was 4.6 months. Aside from olanzapine (time to discontinuation 9.2 months), the other SGAs did not differ from each other or from perphenazine. Except for adverse effects as a reason for discontinuation, differences between the SGAs and the FGA were minimal. In CUtLASS, a 12-month open-label trial, 277 patients were randomized to receive an FGA or a SGA. Again, efficacy was rather similar between the two groups, with only limited improvement of psychopathology and quality of life. The authors of both trials concluded that SGAs do not markedly differ from FGAs regarding compliance, quality of life and effectiveness. The methodological problems of both trials have been discussed extensively. Patients had psychotic symptoms that were moderate in severity and were at least partially treatment resistant. The marginal improvement observed indicated that this population might not be appropriate to detect differences between FGAs and SGAs. Specific issues of CATIE include the exclusion of patients with tardive dyskinesia in the perphenazine arm and the high discontinuation rate. In CUtLASS, the concept of including 13 different FGAs and four SGAs in the respective classes was problematic. It is of interest that the most widely prescribed drug was sulpiride--of the FGAs, this is probably the 'most atypical' drug. Aside from the finding that the advantages of the SGAs are not as strong as early trials and marketing suggested or promised, the trials do not provide much helpful information regarding everyday practice. For tardive dyskinesia, no conclusions at all can be drawn. Similarly, methodological problems inhibited the detection of the other major advantage of the SGAs, i.e. the improved subjective well-being/quality of life while receiving these agents. It is well known that patients' and doctors' perspectives differ markedly, and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS), an expert-rated scale used in both trials, might not be sensitive enough to detect the subjective advantages reported by the majority of patients in other trials. CATIE and CUtLASS suggest that SGAs do not live up to all the previous expectations. However, even if most of these advantages are debatable, the lower risk of tardive dyskinesia and the better subjective effects should be strong enough reasons to favour these drugs. There is no single antipsychotic that is best for every schizophrenia patient, as individual responses differ markedly. For successfully individualized treatment, a multitude of antipsychotic options are needed.

T1  - Improvement and decline of cognitive function in schizophrenia over one year: a longitudinal investigation using latent growth modelling
N2  - BACKGROUND: Long-term follow-up studies of people with schizophrenia report stability of cognitive performance; less is known about any shorter-term changes in cognitive function. METHODS: This longitudinal study aimed to establish whether there was stability, improvement or decline in memory and executive functions over four assessments undertaken prospectively in one year. Cognitive performance was assessed during randomized controlled trials of first- and second-generation antipsychotic medication. Analyses used a latent growth modeling approach, so that individuals who missed some testing occasions could be included and trajectories of cognitive change explored despite missing data. RESULTS: Over the year there was significant decline in spatial recognition but no change in pattern recognition or motor speed. Improvement was seen in planning and spatial working memory tasks; this may reflect improved strategy use with practice. There were significant individual differences in the initial level of performance on all tasks but not in rate of change; the latter may have been due to sample size limitations. Age, sex, premorbid IQ and drug class allocation explained significant variation in level of performance but could not predict change. Patients randomized to first-generation drugs improved more quickly than other groups on the planning task. CONCLUSION: We conclude that cognitive change is present in schizophrenia but the magnitude of change is small when compared with the large differences in cognitive function that exist between patients. Analyses that retain patients who drop out of longitudinal studies, as well as those who complete testing protocols, are important to our understanding of cognition in schizophrenia.

Results  Both drugs were effective in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia ( P > 0.05).  While risperidone has fewer side effects than sulpride. Conclusion  Sulpride ’s superior effect on negative symptoms of schizophrenia may be related to its affinity to DA2 receptors. Risperidone’s superior effect on negative symptoms of schizophrenia may be related to its affinity to 52HT receptors And risperidone’s fewer side effects may be related to its equal affinity to 52HT and DA receptors.

T1  - Clinical trials of sulpiride (1403 RD - Dogmatil): its advantages prescribed alone or in combination
N2  - Administered sulpiride, a psychotropic drug whose structure differs from other such drugs, to 65 patients, 42 women and 23 men, ranging in age from 15 to 74 yrs. 45 patients were hospitalized. Diagnoses were melancholia in 10, mania in 3, neurotic depression in 17, organic depression in 7, schizophrenia in 19, and chronic delirium in 9. The dosage was 300-600 mg/day intramuscularly in inpatients, usually for 10 days, after which the drug was given orally in a dose ranging from 400-1,200 mg/day. The duration of treatment ranged from 45 to 210 days. Other drugs used were antidepressants, ECS therapy, major tranquilizers, and diazepam and bartiburates. Used alone, sulpiride was effective in schizophrenia, but not in mania, melancholia, or cyclic psychoses. When combined with antidepressants or antipsychotic drugs, sulpiride was a valuable adjunct; extrapyramidal effects occurred in only 8 of 21 patients not receiving antiparkinson medication. No sedative or autonomic effects were observed. (English summary)

T1  - Antipsychotic combination using low-dose antipsychotics is as efficacious and safe as, but cheaper, than optimal-dose monotherapy in the treatment of schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind study
N2  - The use of antipsychotic combination has been increasing during the last decade. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose amisulpride plus low-dose sulpiride with full-dose amisulpride in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. In this 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose study, patients were randomized to antipsychotic combination (400 mg/day amisulpride plus 800 mg/day sulpiride, N=46) or monotherapy (800 mg/day amisulpride, N=46) groups. Efficacy measurements included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and subscales, and other scales. Safety and quality of life were also assessed. Response was defined as a 30% reduction in the PANSS total score. Both groups were similar in terms of the following: (a) clinical characteristics at baseline, (b) response rates, and (c) score changes in all psychopathology measures, quality of life, and all side-effect scales after 6 weeks of treatment. There were also no significant between-group differences in changes in other safety measurement. However, the combination strategy did reduce treatment costs. The current study suggests that an antipsychotic combination of low-dose antipsychotics is as efficacious and safe as, but cheaper than, optimal-dose monotherapy in the treatment of schizophrenia.
