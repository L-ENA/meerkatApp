T1  - Controlled study of the disinhibiting effect of low doses of sulpiride in severe schizophrenic psychoses
N2  - This controlled study is designed to confirm the clinical impression concerning the dual therapeutic effect of sulpiride (disinhibitory effect at low doses and activity reducer at higher doses). When describing either 150 mg or 1,200 mg of sulpiride for hebephrenic patients, it seems that the benefits only occur in the patients prescribed the smaller dose. The correlation between dosage-plasma level-and beneficial result, is discussed.

N2  - Compared normal (400 mg, 3 times/day) vs low (50 mg, 3 times/day) doses of sulpiride in 17 chronic schizophrenics (aged 18â€“35 yrs).
