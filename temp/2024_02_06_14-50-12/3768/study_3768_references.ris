T1  - Ziprasidone 80 mg/day and 160 mg/day in the acute exacerbation of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: a 6 week placebo controlled trial
N2  - In this double-blind study, patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to receive either ziprasidone 80 mg/day (n = 106) or 160 mg/day (n = 104) or placebo (n = 92), for 6 weeks. Both doses of ziprasidone were statistically significantly more effective than placebo in improving the PANSS total, BPRS total, BPRS core items, CGI-S, and PANSS negative subscale scores (p < .05). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day significantly improved depressive symptoms in patients with clinically significant depression at baseline (MADRS > or = 14, over-all mean 23.5) (p < .05) as compared with placebo. The percentage of patients experiencing adverse events was similar in each treatment group, and resultant discontinuation was rare. The most frequent adverse events associated with ziprasidone were generally mild dyspepsia, nausea, dizziness, and transient somnolence. Ziprasidone was shown to have a very low liability for inducing movement disorders and weight gain. The results indicate that ziprasidone is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of the positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

T1  - Ziprasidone treatment of an acute exacerbation of schizoaffective disorder: an analysis of patients
N2  - Summary:. Objective: to investigate ziprasidone in the treatment of an acute exacerbation of schizoaffective disorder. Methods: data from subsets of patients with schizoaffective disorder from two double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies were analyzed. Patients received either fixed oral doses of ziprasidone 40 mg/day (n=16) or 120 mg/day (n=22) for four weeks or ziprasidone 80 mg/day (n=18), or 160 mg/day (n=25) for six weeks, or placebo (n=34) for four or six weeks. Results: ziprasidone 40-160 mg/day produced dose-related reductions in bprs total, bprs core, bprs manic items, and cgi-s scores (pÂ²0.01). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day significantly reduced mean bprs total, bprs core, bprs manic, and cgi-s scores (p<0.05) Compared with placebo. Ziprasidone 120 mg/day significantly reduced mean cgi-s score compared with placebo (p<0.05). Dose-related improvements in mean bprs depressive items and madrs total scores were greater with ziprasidone 40-160 mg/day than with placebo. The total incidence of adverse events with ziprasidone was similar to placebo and no adverse event was dose related. Movement disorders were either absent or very infrequent in a 11 treatment groups. No treatment-emergent mania was reported in any ziprasidone treatment group. Conclusions: ziprasidone appears to reduce overall psychopathology as well as depressive and manic symptoms in an acute exacerbation of schizoaffective disorder and to be very well tolerated. Therefore, further study in schizoaffective disorder, as well as other disorders such as acute mania and bipolar disorder is warranted.

T1  - The efficacy and safety of two fixed doses of ziprasidone in schizophrenia
N2  - Ziprasidone is being investigated as an antipsychotic agent since its high affinity for 5HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for D2 receptors may suggest significant antipsychotic efficacy with low extrapyramidal side-effect (EPS) liability. This 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study was designed to compare the safety, toleration and efficacy of two fixed-dose regimens of ziprasidone (40 mg bid and 80 mg bid) in subjects with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Approximately 300 subjects underwent placebo washout for 3 to 7 days. Patients were then randomized to receive either ziprasidone 40 mg twice daily on days 1 to 41; ziprasidone 40 mg twice daily on days 1 to 2, followed by 80 mg twice daily on days 3 to 41; or placebo. On day 42, subjects received a single morning dose. Efficacy was measured using the PANSS and CGI. Side-effects were limited in both the 80 mg and 160 mg treatment groups. Ziprasidone may prove to be an effective and well-tolerated antipsychotic. The author would like to thank the Ziprasidone Study Group for their participation in this study.
